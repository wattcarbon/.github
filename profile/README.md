# WattCarbon

WattCarbon has launched the first clean energy market aimed at rapidly scaling distributed energy technology, including rooftop solar & storage, electrification, and demand response. Our buildings are responsible for 40% of US and global emissions. By scaling distributed clean energy, we can eliminate these emissions today. We partner with climate-driven companies & organizations, directing funding towards these technologies to lower costs, accelerate deployment, and promote energy equity across the US.
